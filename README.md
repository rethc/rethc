I am an aspiring software developer who enjoys developing web applications and solving problems. I am always interested in learning new technologies to embrace the ever changing and progressing industry. Have a look around my repositories to see what I have worked on and my current projects. 
  

  
- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Project Talent**, a web application that connects job seekers and employers. It provides functions for employers to interact with job seekers with the goal of creating a better recruitment experience. Built with **React.JS** for client-side code, and **ASP.NET Core** and **C#** for cross-platform server-side code. **MongoDB** for the backend database.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.JS, Linux Scripting.

- 💪Progress: Day 10 in the #100DaysOfCode challenge!
